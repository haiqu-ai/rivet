Rivet Transpiler Documentation
==============================
Welcome to Haiqu Rivet Transpiler documentation!

The Rivet Transpiler allows users to design and implement fast automated modular transpilation 
routines with the transpilation stack of their choice. The goal is to allow users complete control
over the process, allowing for greater flexibility and large reductions in transpilation time.

Despite its advanced functionality, Rivet Transpiler is easy to use and includes convenience features, such as performance tracking and debugging.

Rivet Transpiler package provides a family of functions for efficient transpilation
of quantum circuits. See `API Reference` section for more details.
